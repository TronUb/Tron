## Welcome to tron

Everything that you want to know about tron is given here.

### Introduction

Currently there is only one person working on this project, ofc that's me ! I started this project in August 20, 2021. This date is when i changed my tron repo from private to public, i was working on this repo before this date, but we will take this as the creation date of tron userbot.
Its a small project for educational purpose & timepass, it is based on python language with pyrogram library, i am just a beginner in this field & i am trying my best to maintain this project.


### Features & ub information

Tron is built with two pyrogram clients, one is the main userbot and second one is the assistant (bot), the main userbot have modules whereas the assistant have plugins.
I have provided a inline help menu to make it easy for the beginners to look for modules and commands.


### Deployment

Tue userbot can be deployed in heroku, it is also deployable by localhost methods.
