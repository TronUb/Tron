## Welcome to tron

* All you need to know is here.

### Introduction

* Currently there is only one person working on this project, ofc that's me ! I started this project in _August 20, 2021._ This date is when I changed my Tron repo from private to public, I was working on this repo before this date, but we will take this as the creation date of tron userbot.
Its a small project for educational purpose & timepass, it is based on _Python language_ with _Dan's pyrogram library_, I am just a beginner in this field & I am trying my best to maintain this project.


### Features & ub information

* Tron is built with two pyrogram clients, one is the main userbot and second one is the assistant (bot).


### Deployment

* The userbot can be deployed in heroku, it is also deployable by localhost methods you can do this only if you download and install all the packages from requirements.txt file.
