## Welcome to tron

Here the information about tron is given, it is always updated if any changes are made in tronuserbot.

### Introduction

Currently there is only one person working on this project, ofc that's me ! I started this project in August 20, 2021. This date is when i changed my tron repo from private to public, i was working on this repo before this date, but we will take this as the creation date of tron userbot.
Its a small project for educational purpose & timepass, it is based on python language with pyrogram library, i am just a beginner in this field & i am trying my best to maintain this project.


### Features & ub information

Tron is built with two pyrogram clients, one is the main userbot and second one is the assistant (bot), the main userbot have modules whereas the assistant have plugins.
I have provided a inline help menu to make it easy for the beginners to look for modules and commands.


### Deployment

The userbot can be deployed in heroku, it is also deployable by localhost methods you can do this only if you download and install all the packages from requirements.txt file.
